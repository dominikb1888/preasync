9
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:25.410
Dominik Böhler: But not throughout the whole class, I have a little one sick at home and so open that up and I will look into the recordings later on tonight.

10
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.300
Dominik Böhler: and give you feedback.

11

16
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.620
Dominik Böhler: And I can see that in your eyes you're already so stressed.

17
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.870
Gaurang Thanekar: Oh, it is OK.

18
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.650
Gaurang Thanekar: it's OK.

19
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.020
Dominik Böhler: We can still live, but you know.

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.610
Florian Wahl: The beginning of kindergarten.

21
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.730
Dominik Böhler: And something like that yeah.

22
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.830
Florian Wahl: wow yeah because every time you change the institution and there's a new set of.

23
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.050
Florian Wahl: stuff going on.

24
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.950
Florian Wahl: yeah.

25
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.660
Dominik Böhler: we're quite good at catching.

26
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Florian Wahl: yeah honestly for the parents there's always something in there.

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.660
But.

28
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.820
Dominik Böhler: yeah yeah.

29
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:34.320
Dominik Böhler: It we've actually had him to be fair, since Christmas we've had I think two weeks, where no one was sick they were like the last two weeks speaking end of May, beginning of April.

30
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.120
Dominik Böhler: So.

31
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.320
Florian Wahl: We do.

32
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.010
Dominik Böhler: Something to.

33
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.080
Florian Wahl: look forward to I guess.

34
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.770
Dominik Böhler: But guys i'm recording this if you're not Okay, with it, then please tell me shut down your screen whatever you prefer doing.

35
00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.930
Dominik Böhler: If you're absolutely not Okay, then send me your presentation, where teams put them into teams channel if you can also send it to me in another way to the link in there.

36
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.770
Dominik Böhler: And i'm committed to giving you that feedback.

37
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.720
Dominik Böhler: All right, so for that, for the rest of the session for and will take over and then later on you're still there musi will come in, and so you you're taking care of.

38
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.670
Florian Wahl: All the best to eclipse and you, of course.

39
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.520
Dominik Böhler: Thanks very much and I will.

40
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.090
Dominik Böhler: give you Florian the.

41
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.710
Dominik Böhler: Meeting host rights just let me know once you change and Lucy is there, can I pop in again from.

42
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:49.320
Dominik Böhler: So looking forward to your results intermediate results, even though I cannot be there as synchronously in the digital world, it should not matter right, and you will receive everything.

43
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.150
Dominik Böhler: later on.

44
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.410
Dominik Böhler: And I wish you good time with.

45
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.090
Gaurang Thanekar: season.

46
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.820
Florian Wahl: Oh, I think I have to talk now.

47
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:20.100
Florian Wahl: Good morning, everyone i'm thrilled today round of presentations I think right so maybe we start with a hidden layers.

48
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.170
Florian Wahl: So, how does you can probably just share your screen, or do you need some extra rights.

49
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.760
Ledia Leka: Good.

50
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.920
Florian Wahl: morning.

51
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.590
Edina Larios: Please do let me know if you can hear me i'm hiding in the living room honestly.

52
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.140
Can you hear me yes.

53
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.380
Amelie Haas: trying to figure out the.

54
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.220
Amelie Haas: Presentation again.

55
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:26.490
Edina Larios: So good morning and i'm going to start us off, we are the hidden layers shockingly, and this is our scoring points from the last two weeks.

56
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:42.900
Edina Larios: We still keeping this face because it's just that good on the American you jump on to the next slide Okay, so in the first part of representation we're going to talk a little bit about what we actually achieved in the last two weeks, just like last time.

57
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.950
Edina Larios: First i'm going to start us off that as dominic also.

58
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.420
Edina Larios: instructed we continued with the interviews We already have a couple of them in so we also started essentially analyzing those.

59
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.550
Edina Larios: which I am going to talk about in a second into a certain extent.

60
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:20.670
Edina Larios: And from product management side I also continued reviewing APP feedbacks or reading reviews essentially just to get a little bit of more fear to what the people want essentially American shortly jump on to the next slide and then we're going to come back to this one for you muna.

61
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.130
Edina Larios: Exactly so.

62
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:32.910
Edina Larios: The couple of answers what we already received from the first round of interviews from our own network already starts to show a certain pattern.

63
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:53.010
Edina Larios: This clearly is going to change as we go on as well with the more deeper layer questions, as it is, but this is already certainly something what we could start basing our possible solution later on how many, can I ask you to jump back to the previous one, thank you very much.

64
00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:01.950
Edina Larios: So I said you already have the first round of interviews and the analysis of results, we are also flow and thank you again, very much for setting us up with.

65
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:15.450
Edina Larios: Your data scientists contacts and we already had an interview with Julia and we're waiting on are already in the process of arranging a schedule with the other two gentlemen.

66
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:25.140
Edina Larios: For some kind of appointment and then here, I am going to give over to your Mona and she's going to talk a little bit about.

67
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.580
Edina Larios: Business approach ideas, what we are exploring at the moment.

68
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.770
Yamuna Bandaru: Okay Good morning, this is a webinar we have done some brainstorming exercise on business ideas like.

69
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:48.360
Yamuna Bandaru: With the APP we can offer one feature like sleep tracking fully for free, but we offer other features like fitness vitals etc, with some amount of payment.

70
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:57.630
Yamuna Bandaru: And the other one we thought is like if we want to motivate the users, we need to make them active in participation fulfilling service.

71
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:06.660
Yamuna Bandaru: So we plan to get coupons in exchange for filling service regularly and these coupons can be used as free monthly subscriptions.

72
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:24.870
Yamuna Bandaru: And finally, once we all know that consumers are often more histon to donate the data unless they know the exact uses of their data, so we want to design an additional future to maintain transparency, like consumer can have control and choose what data is being used for them.

73
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:39.960
Yamuna Bandaru: And coming to know networking, we are, we talked to we are waiting for the replace of sleep scientists be negotiating to fix an appointment with them and.

74
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:51.000
Yamuna Bandaru: We reached out to network of interested participants up to 22 persons and we analyze the results, as I didn't explain that's it for my son.

75
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:08.130
Amelie Haas: yeah that's me bear with leak into through sleep statistics again, well, we found out last week that about it, or that 80% of pregnant women experienced some form of tanya.

76
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:17.550
Amelie Haas: which we took as incentive to actually talk to her three of my friends who are pregnant, at the moment, and my neighbor who's in the wife.

77
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:26.160
Amelie Haas: and actually asked them do you especially, especially now have problems with sleep in your pregnancy.

78
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:46.920
Amelie Haas: And with my neighbor a midwife, we also talk or I also talked to her and was like okay what what's your experience on that and, interestingly two out of the three seed, they have really intensive dreams which they didn't have before, for example, and that they need a lot of sleep.

79
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.130
Amelie Haas: And yes, this is all.

80
00:09:51.240 --> 00:10:06.690
Amelie Haas: you're influenced and called upon by their pregnancy, so the pregnancy is actually reason for some kind of sleeping problems, all three of them say that they they are usually good sleepers so.

81
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:16.020
Amelie Haas: insomnia, or something like that is not a problem for them, but just in general they need at least nine hours of sleep a day.

82
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:26.910
Amelie Haas: And one girl sleeps at night because she doesn't have to get up in the morning and another one says she's so tired in the afternoon, she sleeps at least one hour in the afternoon.

83
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:39.600
Amelie Haas: But also, even though she used to be a night owl and don't look dumb third and like to get up in the morning, she now get wakes up at five between five and six, eight and can't go back to sleep.

84
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:52.410
Amelie Haas: So, since they all didn't really have like insomnia, and see problems they didn't win relative right people to ask how those could be solved and how they think that could be resolved.

85
00:10:53.910 --> 00:11:02.490
Amelie Haas: But they all three of them thought that pregnant women would be really, really willing to donate a data, because it might actually help.

86
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.880
Amelie Haas: Science and improving the pregnancy care as well.

87
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.370
Amelie Haas: And then I think i'm going to hand over to Mattel yeah.

88
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.350
Amelie Haas: I think it's me.

89
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.480
Matilda Simon: Oh, this one yeah.

90
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.080
that's me.

91
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:30.330
Matilda Simon: So yeah for the next scrub we are planning to start conceptualizing how our next round of interviews will go probably some more specific demographic.

92
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:44.310
Matilda Simon: Perhaps going further with the pregnant women, as well as to analyze any incoming data we have in the form of coding and review and qualitative interview data and further analyzing any Moxley data that we have already acquired.

93
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:53.580
Matilda Simon: And second we plan to venture a few different approaches to how the product will be utilized in either a consumer scientific or a generic sense.

94
00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:01.980
Matilda Simon: And we will continue to look at and compare profit versus nonprofit models and think about how we will incentivize all potential stakeholders.

95
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:15.510
Matilda Simon: And lastly, we will continue to research, what type of data is needed or lacking in sleep research and how the different data types are available for the consumer from each current wearable on the market and how they differ from each other.

96
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.870
Matilda Simon: Thank you for that we we do next.

97
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.280
Ledia Leka: Okay, so this time I am.

98
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:33.780
Ledia Leka: Now our steps are our plans for the next chrome we as modular said, are planning to conduct.

99
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:44.490
Ledia Leka: participant interviews that next phase second phase, and then we were thinking about starting with first ui design ideas I just don't have our basic.

100
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:52.440
Ledia Leka: basic idea of the APP or what are we trying to do, and the features that it is going to include also we.

101
00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:10.410
Ledia Leka: plan our idea eating of business model, and also how can specific data extracted from wearable databases, this is a research question that we're going to spend a lot of time researching the last step for the next round is to IDA IDA different approaches and their evaluation.

102
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:26.130
Edina Larios: yeah right here, essentially, we just arrived again to the usual we have questions for you as well, and in this crumb.

103
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:43.290
Edina Larios: We have a question to you furious, but this is probably something what we can then, and we should probably manage in a breakout room or something later on, perhaps, and then later on and museum rights, we will also have some technical related or tech yeah ah.

104
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.750
Florian Wahl: So both of these.

105
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.090
Edina Larios: awesome awesome.

106
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.730
Florian Wahl: And yeah it's.

107
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.560
Florian Wahl: it's nice to see that you're doing good.

108
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.250
Florian Wahl: Progress can really look again at this survey outputs.

109
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.220
Florian Wahl: The survey output back, I think it was in the very beginning, you have a couple of graphs and stuff.

110
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:12.930
Florian Wahl: yeah.

111
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:36.420
Amelie Haas: So yeah basically what we did here is when we asked in our interviews in our participants we basically asked some some personal data, whether they're male or female, whether they live in our rural or urban area, so this is just where they where they.

112
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.780
Are.

113
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.860
Amelie Haas: So basically how how loud or unreadiness really.

114
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:53.640
Amelie Haas: Maybe that can have an impact on sleep for quite likely to have an impact on sleep, then we asked if they have wearables used to know.

115
00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:07.710
Amelie Haas: Whether they were a during the night or notch and if provided was that question where we If science, was able to provide a variable for you, would you wear it.

116
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.180
Amelie Haas: So you provided with 25%.

117
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:22.770
Amelie Haas: Then we asked something about data protection so in order to keep that data valid and significant which we talked about with Julia.

118
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:44.250
Amelie Haas: We asked if it were Okay, for them to just change the name and age so change the eight within a different within a certain age group to actually keep a comparable but change the personal data, a little bit, but not fully anonymize it defined yeah just.

119
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.940
Florian Wahl: So.

120
00:15:49.200 --> 00:16:01.800
Amelie Haas: Basically, if i'm donating my data, my name is Emily 25 i'm from a rural area i'm not pregnant if if I were to donate my data I might not want that people know that my name is i'm going to 25.

121
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.480
Amelie Haas: So we could change my name to I don't know motto, and my age to 28 and then it's not.

122
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.060
Amelie Haas: Like.

123
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:24.720
Amelie Haas: A certain age group that we're keeping me in which is my actual age group, because you probably know, this leap changes there with growing and aging.

124
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:48.960
Florian Wahl: Well, but what would be what we would usually do on us to to in the beginning, not asked for the edge and years, but rather to like put people in a bin right away like say I don't know i'm between 20 and 30 years old or i'm back to save to that and in such a way right so that.

125
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.490
Florian Wahl: anyways.

126
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.090
Florian Wahl: is not transparent, the actual age.

127
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.500
Amelie Haas: yeah so we were we weren't sure how what the actual procedure is they are so we just wanted to make sure that.

128
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.580
Amelie Haas: we're okay for.

129
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:10.440
Amelie Haas: The majority of people and, as you can see 82% were of the 22 persons that we interviewed so far see.

130
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.780
Amelie Haas: Here that's me no problem.

131
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.580
Florian Wahl: it's Nice.

132
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.530
Florian Wahl: I like yeah.

133
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.950
Amelie Haas: yeah yeah I was going to go on to the next one, but.

134
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.860
Florian Wahl: I like.

135
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.760
Florian Wahl: That you collected quite some data so it's 20 something people 22 or something right.

136
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.540
yeah.

137
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.260
Florian Wahl: Be careful with.

138
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.000
Florian Wahl: So.

139
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.710
Florian Wahl: there's couple of things that I would be careful with that's what this past no data diagram.

140
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:56.160
Florian Wahl: it's a bit confusing because you think that the enters a lot bigger and until you realize that you plot basically the same people want for male female and then for your URBAN.

141
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:06.420
Florian Wahl: Okay, and the other thing that I was thinking that could be nice in this content to donation diagram because that's quite important right.

142
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:27.690
Florian Wahl: You could maybe stack that bars for yes and then stack the bars for undecided and the bars for now, and like give them different colors because, basically, yes, yes it's transparent and, yes, if it's for science, we could kind of turn all of them into a yes right.

143
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:29.730
Amelie Haas: yeah.

144
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.680
Florian Wahl: Because we brand to be transparent.

145
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.440
Amelie Haas: yeah.

146
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.650
Florian Wahl: we've always for science so yeah.

147
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.660
Florian Wahl: But other than that this.

148
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.740
Florian Wahl: is really good.

149
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:52.290
Florian Wahl: Did you were able to draw any conclusions, for example, just narrowing it to pregnant.

150
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.440
Florian Wahl: parsons or when it.

151
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:57.780
Florian Wahl: Is.

152
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.060
Florian Wahl: it's an interesting idea, I think.

153
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.700
Amelie Haas: yeah I.

154
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.970
Florian Wahl: gotta hand it limits your target group, like very much right, but it could be a good thing for the first experiment to say okay let's collect data from.

155
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:22.440
Florian Wahl: Pregnant women that are just a couple of advantages, because they will be at home, more and they might be more compliant because.

156
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:37.200
Florian Wahl: They have quite some time on their hands, especially in the end to the last trimester they might you know, be in bed a lot and boys, so they might be perfect for asking them a lot of questions.

157
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.210
Florian Wahl: Because they might be a welcome distraction, you know.

158
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.050
Florian Wahl: yeah.

159
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.440
Florian Wahl: i'd say found.

160
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.730
Florian Wahl: Another link i'll send it to you and your team's channel.

161
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:14.430
Florian Wahl: That sums up because I never heard about this dreams thing and then I wondered whether the sleep structure changes so whether there was more rem sleep or not, because I think this dreaming happened in in around I found.

162
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:22.770
Florian Wahl: And there's a nice write up was or, especially on the effects that happened during the third trimester.

163
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.910
Florian Wahl: For sleep and pregnancy.

164
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:45.750
Amelie Haas: yeah To be honest, the interviews with my friends, I just did yesterday and the day before said that's also fairly new we didn't really go into detail on what the outcome was about so within research any and yeah any dream related to pregnancy.

165
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.150
Amelie Haas: papers you.

166
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.400
Florian Wahl: haven't heard about that, before.

167
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:59.610
Amelie Haas: yeah but also lydia just sit quite correctly and when we talked to Julia she was also really interested.

168
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:08.790
Amelie Haas: In really kind of excited we might go into the direction of pregnant women and maybe even young parents.

169
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.330
Florian Wahl: Other it's good because she's asleep researcher so.

170
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.140
Florian Wahl: yeah you can win her over that's that's good.

171
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.450
Amelie Haas: yeah she said she's working in a completely different direction at the moment.

172
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.540
Florian Wahl: I think sparks now by excess was related to.

173
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.430
Amelie Haas: Something because the brain.

174
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.140
Amelie Haas: yeah I can't remember which.

175
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:52.170
Florian Wahl: yeah we both did our PhD and like one of these really big Dutch hundred programs, but there was a lot of different projects and every project had like one or two PhDs and maybe a postdoc.

176
00:21:53.490 --> 00:22:01.470
Florian Wahl: And that's how we met because we went to sleep cluster but the stuff that I did was very technical and then her stop us.

177
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:18.180
Florian Wahl: She did a lot of research on on high school students and sleep I don't know if she told you about top to bottom, so looked into how the school timing influences the great's of students, depending on the time which is super interesting.

178
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.700
Amelie Haas: yeah absolutely.

179
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.340
Florian Wahl: And just very, very connected and asleep.

180
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.560
Florian Wahl: Research words.

181
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.430
yeah.

182
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.100
Florian Wahl: it's good that you contact which are and also Thomas.

183
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.970
Florian Wahl: I think, is also quite interesting.

184
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:40.830
Florian Wahl: yeah I see, I saw its access to a lot of population, so I think.

185
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:47.850
Amelie Haas: yeah I think he was a Thomas who emailed us back and see to super busy in April, so we could maybe do the 12th of May.

186
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.410
Florian Wahl: yeah but just do it.

187
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.570
Florian Wahl: Naturally personally.

188
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:52.920
yeah.

189
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.960
Florian Wahl: Maybe by then.

190
00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:02.340
Florian Wahl: You have an idea of what you want to do, and you can just pitch it to him and see how you react so that might be might be interesting.

191
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.320
Amelie Haas: yeah might be good, just before the midterm.

192
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.030
Amelie Haas: Exactly.

193
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:15.690
Amelie Haas: yeah so one more thing that I was thinking that I haven't actually pitch to the group yet, but for the extra I want to contact lunchtime medical.

194
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.490
Amelie Haas: and see if they have some interesting insights as well, and they have an office here in New York, and so I might actually just swing by with a bike one day.

195
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.730
Amelie Haas: Next, two weeks and see if they can be of any assistance to us.

196
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.310
Florian Wahl: yeah sounds good okay I didn't know.

197
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.310
Florian Wahl: And they have a sleep Center as well.

198
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.860
Florian Wahl: All right, they're doing this.

199
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.960
Florian Wahl: sleep abner stuff.

200
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.010
yeah.

201
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:45.810
Florian Wahl: Good.

202
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.780
Florian Wahl: yeah that's a pretty big business as well.

203
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:56.520
Florian Wahl: So a lot of people suffer from that and it's becoming one why because I think it's also related to obesity.

204
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:15.510
Amelie Haas: yeah I mean I know from my parents circle of friends and my uncle, for example, he's he's an engineer to is really intelligent, but since he got his smartwatch a couple of weeks ago he sees how bad he's sleeping and now it's a big deal.

205
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.500
Florian Wahl: I will always.

206
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.560
Amelie Haas: That it is huge.

207
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:29.880
Florian Wahl: yeah Another thing I think that could be really interesting, but this is maybe a project for next year, then as.

208
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:42.300
Florian Wahl: You have your smartphone a lot of times in the bedroom right a lot of people keep it there, so could be interesting to monitor like snoring behavior I think somebody should be doing this already but.

209
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:54.960
Florian Wahl: For the sleep apnea you put I mean normally people are sent to like a sleep lab to detect it like whether the health insurance would pay for one of these breathing devices right.

210
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.300
Florian Wahl: Because what happens is that you basically.

211
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:10.620
Florian Wahl: suffocate I think you suffocate just after is like basically you stop breathing you don't get any air and then at some point, basically resume.

212
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.350
Florian Wahl: By waking up usually and and grasping for air.

213
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:17.910
Florian Wahl: But.

214
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:27.030
Florian Wahl: Right usually that happens right, it could also be that basically you don't wake up anymore and.

215
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:40.290
Florian Wahl: So I think usually put people into a sleep lab to detect that but there's a something that you could easily do with audio recordings right and machine learning so.

216
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.340
Edina Larios: The Apps actually even has not.

217
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:58.320
Edina Larios: Software as medical device or application as medical device but it's still kind of has a recommendation that a the APP the accelerometer or whatever detected that you're you're kind of not reading what's going on, so somebody.

218
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:03.930
Edina Larios: might even if they are not categorized as a medical device they kind of already at least make a suggestion for this.

219
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.970
Florian Wahl: yeah also the lean.

220
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.370
Florian Wahl: muscles the breathing frequency when you're asleep.

221
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.740
Florian Wahl: So that's right cool.

222
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.220
Florian Wahl: All right, um so.

223
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.650
Florian Wahl: let's do your questions.

224
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.830
Florian Wahl: Maybe really quick anyway, and then we do the other group.

225
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.160
Florian Wahl: So.

226
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.070
Florian Wahl: Because.

227
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:34.830
Florian Wahl: So i'm interested in in this sleep data analysis in the long run, but of course for that.

228
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.840
Florian Wahl: The tracking right I don't know if this question is more complex than that.

229
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:43.860
Amelie Haas: yeah.

230
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.800
Amelie Haas: After last week's session.

231
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.730
Amelie Haas: We were a little frustrated.

232
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.200
Really.

233
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.630
Edina Larios: well.

234
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:02.310
Amelie Haas: And we really just wanted to talk to you like what, what do you expect from us in this semester.

235
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.220
Amelie Haas: In this project.

236
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:19.860
Edina Larios: Essentially, felt that the other mentor or the other projects, the other mentors had a very clear message already groups, however, we felt that we might have missed your message so.

237
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.550
Florian Wahl: I know.

238
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:26.820
Edina Larios: We weren't sure which direction are you aiming or seeking maybe here.

239
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.410
Florian Wahl: So for me.

240
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.700
Florian Wahl: My goal was.

241
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:40.920
Florian Wahl: To not give you like, a direction, because I think this is the idea of the project, for you have missed any message, but if that frustrates you I can give you a more clear direction and that's what.

242
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.300
Edina Larios: it's.

243
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.430
Edina Larios: About frustrating it's frustrated us if we have mess, because we.

244
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.450
Edina Larios: missed something.

245
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.800
Edina Larios: If we didn't miss anything.

246
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.210
Edina Larios: And I.

247
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.590
Florian Wahl: used to develop your own APP and.

248
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.280
Florian Wahl: I think that even if you decide.

249
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.170
Florian Wahl: To go for this pregnant women.

250
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.950
example.

251
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:11.790
Florian Wahl: Like if you decide to build in the under sleep APP for pregnant women that's completely fine with me, even though that's not what I had in mind at all.

252
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.390
Florian Wahl: But I think that's very interesting so um.

253
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:27.420
Florian Wahl: For me, the part that i'm really interested in would be to have an APP that can kind of track the sleep behavior based on what's available in an apple has or Google fit.

254
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:37.140
Florian Wahl: that's for me the interesting bit, and I think that, no matter what you do this will kind of be a byproduct of offered you achieve this semester.

255
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.760
Amelie Haas: yeah I guess so because.

256
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.500
Amelie Haas: i'm out of.

257
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.770
Florian Wahl: It doesn't matter if you if your target group is.

258
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.550
Florian Wahl: pregnant women or marathon runners right.

259
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.340
Florian Wahl: In the end, this is like the technical bit, this is what you should leverage.

260
00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.810
Florian Wahl: And then i'm fine with that because I can then we can take this product and shape it into something else later right.

261
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:20.820
Florian Wahl: And I think that also is quite smart as one way, for example, to vote would be to develop it and the cost for one smile target group, like pregnant women it's quite a small tiger group, even though three friends are pregnant, at the moment seems like a lot but.

262
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:22.770
Amelie Haas: Age.

263
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.410
Florian Wahl: Group.

264
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.380
Florian Wahl: But.

265
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:39.840
Florian Wahl: The cool thing is that later on right if you have that you can just basically change to you I a bit and change the analysis and then you have like a completely different maybe for.

266
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:50.880
Florian Wahl: Elderly of our runners or whatever, so the part that i'm interested in is to build some kind of APP that allows people to donate their data.

267
00:29:52.050 --> 00:30:03.750
Florian Wahl: And then everything else is fine with me and if, if you want me to like narrow it down for you, we can do that anytime like next week or something that.

268
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:14.550
Amelie Haas: is the reason why we chose the project is we felt like really narrowed down into one direction, with the other ones and we're having ideas, but this one and thought we could actually.

269
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.770
Florian Wahl: bring it open, you can.

270
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.510
Florian Wahl: Basically freely towards one and I question, I can.

271
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:35.820
Florian Wahl: Maybe answer as well, so for the enemy session you don't really need a iPad because you can just like the name, I would just leave it out, I will just give people a number.

272
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:43.590
Florian Wahl: Because that's what you typically do in research and then you can decide that either its side and.

273
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.060
Florian Wahl: So people have just.

274
00:30:49.560 --> 00:31:07.650
Florian Wahl: A number but either somebody hollywood's this key that resolves like this type of those results, the number back into the original name right what email address or whatever right, so that if you wanted to you could later contact the person and ask them questions.

275
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.310
Florian Wahl: And the other question is to go with anonymized so basically you don't record the name at all.

276
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.120
Florian Wahl: And then you just have a number.

277
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.800
Florian Wahl: that's also fine i'm.

278
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:39.180
Florian Wahl: This age with an age group, I would then just go with an age group directly, because then you don't I mean you don't gain anything by changing the age by a little bit plus or minus if you do that random needs, just as good as having HP.

279
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:50.550
Florian Wahl: I think I can kind of so a is kind of a big word so.

280
00:31:52.530 --> 00:32:02.700
Florian Wahl: So I think there's a couple of things that you can do with Ai so first of all, you can visualize a lot of the data, you can aggregate the data and kind of give.

281
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.190
Florian Wahl: People.

282
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:17.790
Florian Wahl: A trend like how they how they will sleep in the future, you can give them personalized tips, this is something that I would do, which is kind of compute what is the best.

283
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.100
Florian Wahl: The best tip to improve the person sleep right.

284
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:29.700
Florian Wahl: Also fights on be thinking about a pregnant women xander you could.

285
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:35.850
Florian Wahl: Tell someone for example okay now you are in, week I don't know 25 right.

286
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.010
Florian Wahl: And so.

287
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:52.920
Florian Wahl: Right now, your sleep is really bad, but don't worry, most of the other pregnant women that were in week I don't know 28 that we're doing a lot better, so it should become better in the next three weeks again right.

288
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.190
Florian Wahl: And then just something that you could provide.

289
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.770
Florian Wahl: At least if it's positive.

290
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:14.250
Edina Larios: We actually even considered this that for the APP we would have a section, which is like our our sleep wiki or something like that, where essentially with Ai we could have personalized.

291
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:24.870
Edina Larios: tips or advances or just information, like a news feed but personalized on that patient or on the participants.

292
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:37.860
Edina Larios: Information essentially what they given that i'm struggling with I don't know insomnia i'm pregnant whatever and then the I can sort out based on the information what to push as naturally to that participant.

293
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:39.870
Florian Wahl: So, on the one hand, right.

294
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:56.340
Florian Wahl: yep this general information, but I will put into a wiki and then I would just this personalized messages I will give them notifications, and then they can control how much of the notifications, they want to pop up or up with a sound and then.

295
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:05.370
Florian Wahl: that's quite interesting so at least the wearables that I use they do that and it's quite cool because, for example, if.

296
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.030
Florian Wahl: My body temperature increases overnight.

297
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.890
Florian Wahl: Then the ring in the morning would say hey watch out today like.

298
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:26.280
Florian Wahl: I think if its course up more than half a degree, it will tell you like okay today So be careful, because obviously nobody's buying something yeah.

299
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:39.630
Florian Wahl: So that's that's quite Nice, and I think with the sleep, this could be the same, that if you detect it a night was really good compared to the night before you could say hey like what did you do different tonight because.

300
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.800
Florian Wahl: Last night, because you slept much better.

301
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.320
you're muted.

302
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.980
Edina Larios: Yes, sorry I was talking to my email working.

303
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.370
hard.

304
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.070
Edina Larios: I will thank you very much.

305
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.170
Florian Wahl: coffee.

306
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.620
Edina Larios: I would have a kind of going out on a stretch question.

307
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.870
Edina Larios: which inspired me by what you said, but we actually even consider this.

308
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:10.590
Before.

309
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.630
Edina Larios: And i'm not gonna lie that it just escaped me right now so i'm just going to come back with you that.

310
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.350
So I.

311
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.790
Florian Wahl: think we can continue with the presentation of.

312
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.860
Florian Wahl: The other group that is the deep divers.

313
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.700
Amelie Haas: Actually, can I just have.

314
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:37.230
Amelie Haas: One more question because last week we when we talk to to to dominic it was.

315
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.430
Florian Wahl: Well, so there was a visitor.

316
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.240
Oh good.

317
00:35:49.560 --> 00:36:00.390
Amelie Haas: yeah last week when we talked to dominic he was really clear about us being too specific already, but now talking to you, it sounds like it's okay that we're already that specific so.

318
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.840
Amelie Haas: Well, how should we keep going.

319
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.600
Florian Wahl: yeah I think dominick.

320
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.750
Florian Wahl: Cruz, he wants to to spend the first half.

321
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:19.080
Florian Wahl: kind of narrowing it down I The thing is that, in the beginning, I wrote like a very specific document on what you should do and he said oh that's way too specific.

322
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.830
Florian Wahl: Type try to keep it as specific as I can so.

323
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:40.470
Florian Wahl: yeah I think have capital of my interviews with this other experts and then narrow it down until the mid term but maybe there's some things that either way you need right, if you think, for example, about the ui of the APP.

324
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:57.720
Florian Wahl: there's probably some things that you need any way, like some visualization of the sleep time stripe or the grammar type or whatever the things that you would probably need to whether you do this for pregnant people or marathon runners.

325
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:06.390
Amelie Haas: I mean that was the thing that dominic said last week it was like, why do we want to build an APP, why is it not something else and.

326
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:18.420
Amelie Haas: So we went out into that direction, the last week two, and you know kind of did some brainstorming and thought of different approaches which will already also had an hour presentation.

327
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:35.130
Amelie Haas: To basically just say Okay, can we can we can look at it from a scientific point of view and we don't actually get the users, but we we build an APP for scientists to contact users or two to get the data from there, or I don't know how.

328
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:51.120
Amelie Haas: or can we just do like a middle we're where we say okay and we're just doing a whit whit just transferring data from Google and apple how to another scientific database.

329
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:58.500
Amelie Haas: So you should Should we continue down that direction, what other approaches, we could go to also we actually go for.

330
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.450
Amelie Haas: User base.

331
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.240
Florian Wahl: You can you can explore that, of course, the question is how do you want to.

332
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.370
Florian Wahl: Get the data out with.

333
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:21.000
Florian Wahl: out an APP in the end, and do you want to give feedback to the user side because if you want to give feedback to the user side and you want to access that data in apple Google fit.

334
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.630
Florian Wahl: it's gonna be difficult, without an APP I think.

335
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.740
Florian Wahl: So I know that, for example, with the ordering so I pulled some data of.

336
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.100
Florian Wahl: One of our scientists than me.

337
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.030
Florian Wahl: And I send it to Matilda last week.

338
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:58.200
Florian Wahl: So, with the ordering you can access that through a regular API, but I think for the other variables I don't know if it's possible and you will have to write an API for each variable and that was the idea of the project was a bit too to use like.

339
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:11.130
Florian Wahl: to access the data on another level, where, basically, you have to have that already collect all the data from artists variable so they already do the work of integrating all this wearable devices.

340
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.350
Florian Wahl: So you don't have to do that.

341
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:26.430
Florian Wahl: You can explore it, I think that in the end, that will make most sense, but if you have I mean might be frustrating but.

342
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:40.500
Florian Wahl: If you if you find a good use case that can, if you find a convincing case that you can do it without an actor, it would mean whatever you can dip out in terms of work.

343
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.900
Amelie Haas: it's.

344
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:49.830
Florian Wahl: Or you can whatever you can simplify let's put it that way it's probably a good idea, because.

345
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:57.990
Florian Wahl: The second half of the Semester is really over quite quickly and building things takes time.

346
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.150
Florian Wahl: But.

347
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:06.540
Florian Wahl: i'm not sure if there's an easier solution than using apple.

348
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.880
Florian Wahl: And just building an APP.

349
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:10.620
Florian Wahl: Because.

350
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:18.630
Florian Wahl: Then you would have to access all this different api's separately and you have the other thing is that.

351
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.890
Florian Wahl: You have to build something that can ask the API the user for permission right.

352
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.690
Florian Wahl: So.

353
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:42.660
Florian Wahl: I think you could do it with a web APP but then also, how do you drive people there and what, what do you give back to the users and how do you do that right, you could send them, maybe Meriden weather report summarizing everything.

354
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:45.930
Florian Wahl: yeah but.

355
00:40:47.820 --> 00:41:05.640
Florian Wahl: I feel like and then think about you're pregnant women rights to spend a lot of time in bed, and not in front of a computer so they have a smartphone with them, and maybe a tablets but they're not going to end up on some website they're going to end up in some APP.

356
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.340
Florian Wahl: well.

357
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.050
Ledia Leka: Our answer, so thank you.

358
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.840
Ledia Leka: we're just a little bit confused.

359
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.190
and

360
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.330
Florian Wahl: Think it's time for a deep divers are they here.

361
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah.

362
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.080
Florian Wahl: hi.

363
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.920
Shailly Upadhyay: Hello Florian I let me share the screen.

364
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:49.950
Shailly Upadhyay: Can you see my screen.

365
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.050
Florian Wahl: Yes, it works okay.

366
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:52.800
Shailly Upadhyay: I sorta.

367
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.160
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah so I Florian so in our last session.

368
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:09.510
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And, before that, in the initial session we started with what our basic plan was what our basic idea was so, in short, the basic idea was to.

369
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:18.870
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: was to do an emotional tracking was to create a system to track emotions that emotions and give the user, an idea.

370
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:33.060
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Of what the emotional State currently is and what the emotional state was in the spectrum okay to make things more clear to make things more clear okay first, first of all, let me first English, what we are going to present today.

371
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:52.230
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: First, we are, we are going to present our idea with little bit more clarity and, second, of all and, second, we are going to present our survey results survey results in detail and the feedback we have got from the from our survey and what we are planning as immediate step.

372
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.080
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Currently, so.

373
00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.520
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To make our idea more clear what concept we have and what we are working on okay let's start with.

374
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:10.650
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: I think every one of us have used a smartwatch some time or the other, or we have seen someone using a smartwatch.

375
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:19.800
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The what is smart smart watch basically tracks a smartwatch tracks your heart rate I smartwatch tracks your number of steps you have covered.

376
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:39.390
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: In today or the large day or in the previous week it says it monitors how much calories you have burned today or yesterday, or in the last week or how much you have slept in in the current are in the spectrum so on the lines of that our device or our system.

377
00:43:40.890 --> 00:44:05.220
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: aims to tap the emotional state of the user, both in the current in the vr type, as well as over the past day or over the last week okay so on this, this is our basic concept and on the lines of this we move ahead with the ocean and our survey, so, in total, we serve it around.

378
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:19.650
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We serve it around have 50 people and before that we created a detailed questionnaire so once once i'm done to the questionnaire once i'm done to explaining the.

379
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:29.790
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: concept of basic idea will be more clear to you all okay so let's start with the questionnaire now, so the first question we asked.

380
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:45.990
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Our subjects our service objects was, would you be interested in knowing your emotional condition in theory time in moment whether you're feeling stressed or anxious or excited you're in low mood.

381
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:58.290
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Now you're feeling emotional breakdown, are you calm you down the aisle sluggish you hyperactive bold any emotional condition in the time.

382
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:14.790
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And the second question was, would you be interested in knowing your emotional condition in the to spread over the parody with the past week or any space, so all ne specified period of time during the previous days.

383
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:26.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So first question was about in real time second question was about in the respective that third question was, would you be interested in.

384
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:38.820
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: in real time solutions in real science is a time idolize that our session would give to you for this for this all being negative or bothersome emotional states.

385
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:49.950
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: In theory, time to be interested in the theory time solution that you would be receiving from our system to dissolve that bothers them or negative emotional states and our fourth question was.

386
00:45:51.630 --> 00:46:01.260
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Would you be interested in the solution for dissolving negative or bothersome emotional states in the prospect in the past, I mean.

387
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:15.270
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: I mean the our system would have detected your emotion would have grabbed your emotions over the past days or bi weekly and would be suggesting solutions to dissolve that now.

388
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:28.260
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The they will they will take your emotions or the week and for any negative or bothers me state they would be suggesting solutions, now it not in the VI time the fourth question was about to spread.

389
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:42.780
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The fifth question was to be do you believe our emotional tracking system and the desert and possible solution given mechanism could be beneficial to mentally ill people.

390
00:46:45.570 --> 00:47:07.500
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Sites, would you be willing to be a headband or EG device to take your emotions, as part of our system Okay, so I hope our basic concept is a little bit more clear to you right now what we're actually planning to do we actually planning to track the emotional shade of people by.

391
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:31.350
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: By promoting them to wear a headband link to our system and our headband would detect the easy and the EG waves in real time and also over the past week or past days whenever they will that headband and those EG waves he EG studies of.

392
00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:36.210
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: their brains would be analyzed to give out the emotional state.

393
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:43.290
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah so let's move ahead without the district of our survey.

394
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, so.

395
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:53.280
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We had the total participants 50.

396
00:47:54.450 --> 00:48:06.960
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And we have three TEAM members, and we all tried to reach out to as much as people as possible and out of our total number of participants, it is today about 32 males and females.

397
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:23.580
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah so let's move on to the idea, the age group, our of our survey population was between 20 years to 25 years of age, so our target of target look was pretty young people as yet okay let's move on to the next slide.

398
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:39.990
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, so the desert of our first survey is October 1 survey, the first question, the first question, which was would they be interested in knowing the own emotional state in 09.

399
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:55.260
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: It came out to be what 6040 60% of the people were like K yeah they would like to they would like to, and they would be interested in know in they would be interested in knowing the.

400
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:03.690
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: chili 40% of the people would be interested in knowing their emotional state in real time.

401
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:11.610
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: But there is a catch here, which will be which i'll be able to explain with dancers, have further questions 40% of the people were.

402
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:21.030
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Directly they were saying that yeah they would want to do their emotional state in theory time yeah but the 60% were little bit apprehensive.

403
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:33.630
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: With doubtful whether they would like to know your emotional state at the time, because they say Okay, we already know whether what we are feeling like now, but they will not unequivocal.

404
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:39.450
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They were like 50% of people were like Okay, they might they might not.

405
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:50.220
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So we moved out with the second question, and with further questions their opinions became more clear it came with more clarity so.

406
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.480
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: that the second question.

407
00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:04.290
Florian Wahl: I have a question about his remark yeah please in the future, can you go back to the the part time thing.

412
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.770
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah sure these are by nature.

413
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:21.450
Florian Wahl: So, in the future, can you do two things, please not another person.

414
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:24.600
Florian Wahl: With their questions on the bottom and then.

415
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:36.540
Florian Wahl: Yes, in the future, can you do two things, please like first of all right, I mean I would pick maybe two colors but two different Greens but.

416
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:47.070
Florian Wahl: Next time, like what is yes, and what is no and also like maybe right instead of q1 q2 q3 right like the questions.

417
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.890
Florian Wahl: Oh, you have to.

418
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:51.780
Florian Wahl: Read the diagram.

419
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.630
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah yeah I totally understand.

420
00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:04.650
Florian Wahl: For the future, started to write a report or presenters and then this makes it really hard to interpret yeah.

421
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:20.700
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah I totally understand yeah so while explaining it here to explain at every step what question one means what Christian to means okay yeah Okay, let me start from the beginning about the findings of our surveys OK.

422
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:38.940
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: OK so for our question one for a question, one which was the weather, you would be like, would you be interested in knowing what your emotional state in theory time in real time, the answer was on.

423
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:49.980
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The answer was around 6040 around 60% of the people were like okay yeah they would be interested in knowing the emotional state in the theory time.

424
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.460
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They would be interested and 40% of the people were.

425
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:54.780
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Somewhat be vocal.

426
00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:06.120
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They were like they they are not sure whether they would want to nobody was that Okay, they would not want to, but they were not sure they would want to if they would want to because.

427
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:16.050
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Most people already they were saying the 40% of the people were saying okay they're like already know what they're feeling in real time Okay, but.

428
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:33.390
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Their EP vocal answer would become clear with the with the answers of next questions OK so moving on to the question to the question was whether they would be interested in knowing the emotional state in the prospect like.

429
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:43.710
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Like Julian if you have been using this system, since a week or a few days, your emotional state would be recorded by our system.

430
00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:49.620
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And it would be presented to you in forms of a chart or graph.

431
00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:59.760
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah, and so the question was, would you be interested in knowing your emotional state in this perspective What was your emotional state yesterday or over the past week.

432
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:13.650
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: How, you were feeling yesterday from 12pm to 2pm how are you how are you feeling on the previous webinars day from 6pm to 8pm so, would you be interested in knowing that.

433
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:25.800
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So the answer to this was a little bit more unequivocal towards yours was 70% of the people were like emphatic yes answers.

434
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:33.210
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay yeah they would be more interested to it snowing Yes, they would want to have an idea of their emotions in two steps.

435
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:45.180
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Because when when our system tells you that okay so yeah and you felt a little British test out yesterday from 12pm to do PM or last Wednesday from 6pm to 8pm.

436
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:54.090
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: You would have an idea in your mind okay what I was doing that time Okay, maybe I wish I was thinking too much about my work or.

437
00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:03.270
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Or maybe I was thinking too much about my my issues with my friends or my family during that time.

438
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:19.110
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So you can you will be able to correlate the activity you're doing the things we're thinking with your emotional state being shown by our system, so the 30% of the people which we're not sure about a yeses pawns in the question to.

439
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:26.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Most of the people for Question one question two who were towards inclined towards.

440
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:38.580
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The vocal or the notice ponds where those who have not already been exposed to an idea to the idea of using a smart device device to track.

441
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:47.580
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Their body parameters already this thing we have observed it those who have already used or they have seen the close ones, using a smartwatch.

442
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:57.030
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Smart was to track calories in a steps and other body parameters, they were more inclined towards the year sounds because they have been.

443
00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:03.810
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: exposed previously to tracking their body function parameters state monitoring devices.

444
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:16.170
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And so they were able to better comprehend what our system was actually aiming towards and what could be the result of that, and in what way would be it could be beneficial to them.

445
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:32.070
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, so um the question the question three was our question was whether whether you would be interested in having a salvation from our system.

446
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:46.440
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: A suggestion from our system to the address your negative or borders and emotional state in the time What this actually means brilliancy suppose, for example, you're using our system and.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.420
Florian Wahl: Our system get absorbed you're.

450
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.280
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Anxious right now and in the end, if you.

451
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.110
Shailly Upadhyay: are putting your audio is not.

452
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:02.820
Shailly Upadhyay: there.

Florian Wahl: It was gone for like 30 seconds.

457
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:17.430
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Oh OK OK OK sha sha slowly, and I would repeat them, I would repeat, for I think.

458
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:33.720
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The third question, I will start from third question, so our third question asked, would you be live in having suggestions or solutions from our system.

459
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:47.430
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: aimed towards the address will have negative or bother some emotional state in real time, what does it exactly mean, let me elaborate a little bit, for example, so again, if you are using our system.

460
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:55.020
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And if you are very know a headband if you're using our system and you're working right now.

461
00:56:55.530 --> 00:57:04.470
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: you're doing an activity, and right now in the air time you're feeling stressed or anxious and our system detects that you are she is.

462
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:14.640
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And it not just notifies you, but the same time it's suggest you solutions to that does the thing in real time right now.

463
00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:28.710
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Of example like take a little wake tech, you might take a little break slowly on or you might drink a glass of water when they asked for five minutes can take a few deep breaths.

464
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:48.720
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And yeah likewise so this kind of the address the suggestions in real time and in answer to that what we received 50% around 50% of the people like they had an emphatic yes Okay, they would like to have.

465
00:57:49.560 --> 00:58:03.810
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: With this mechanism in real time, but other 50% were were towards they would like to have suggestions, but not in but probably not in real time, because if you're already angry or you're already staged and.

466
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:15.900
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: someone says to you Okay, you are stressed and do this do this do this, then it might be it might not be very good idea in theory time it can make you even more anxious many times so.

467
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:25.650
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And so those 50% who are inclined towards know they were like Okay, they they might they would like to have the test.

468
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:34.170

469
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:49.710
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And that that time, they would be able to appreciate the solutions better Okay, so this desert was better reflected this opinion of this was better reflected in the research of the ocean for to have a question was.

470
00:58:50.820 --> 00:59:00.930
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Whether you would like to have suggestions or advice on our search term to the tourists negative or borders and emotional state in this perspective.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:46.800
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, and the other 20% of people who were like they don't really care.

Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They will they will more mobile phone home those population who were not even interested in knowing the emotional state in the first place, and this this population this.

484
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:11.760
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: No one's that population was more coinciding with that population, which had never used or had no not much exposure to the idea of using.

485
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:33.840
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Any smartwatch is any devices to take the body function parameters okay so yeah let's move to our next question which is, which was question five so by the time we completed our question for our idea of a basic idea or concept our system was almost fully clear.

486
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:44.400
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To the audience to the service objects so as we move to question five the question for five was do you think our system.

487
01:01:45.630 --> 01:02:05.250
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: would be beneficial in the acting emotionally state or monitoring the mental health of mentally ill people who have been diagnosed with who have already been diagnosed with mental health issues, for example, clinical depression or bipolar disorders or skis of PENA.

489
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:28.590
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So those people might require more super supervision by by the relatives or by the adopters and there's one more important factor about.

490
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:37.860
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: This thing with mental health mentally ill people that the suicide rates is significantly higher among mentally ill people.

491
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:58.140
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, so, in response to our equation, however, there was no person of this category of mentally ill people category in our in our sample size but, as per their opinion, these people who are not mentally ill, apparently.

492
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:09.180
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They had an emphatic yes to our question, all of them, emphatically, all of them faith that our search term could surely be very beneficial.

493
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:21.690
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To the supervision and molly emotional health monitoring of mentally ill people, some of them had relatives or friends who had been diagnosed with mental health problems.

494
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:32.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And they had seen them close enough how their life was going and how much important there supervision and monitoring was yeah and.

495

Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Among our sample size, there were five out of 50 there were five.

496
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:46.380
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: medical professionals medical professionals to or some of them at some point of time have dealt with.

497
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:52.710
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Mental health also and they were able to give us better insights to.

498
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:59.550
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We are thankful to them okay so then we move on to our last question and.

499
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.820
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The last question was about.

500
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.140
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Whether whether you are.

501
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:15.330
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: favorable towards using a headband all the time, a headband all the time to record your EG waves.

502
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:26.520
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To track your emotional system deeply So the answer to this thing was a little bit tricky and it was laden with a lots of feedback Okay, let me.

503
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:35.190
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Let me start collaborating it 20% of the people had absolutely no problem with fearing a headband, even if they required to fear it.

504
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:45.960
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Most of the time they these were mostly those people who have been who have been using smart watches, since a long time now, since many years now, and they.

505
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:59.610
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They understand the benefits and they have been using the benefits of smart watches, so they can better appreciate the potential benefits of our system so 20% of these people were had an emphatic years that they would be willing to use a headband.

506
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:08.100
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: All the time whatever time it requires but other 80% who were who did not have an imperative as.

507
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:22.050
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: An older adult one fourth of them had some water strong, though, but others had equivocal opinion neither strong no neither is strong, yes.

508
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:38.610
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And they were more like that, if you could modify a headband towards towards a CAP towards a hat or the towards a hair band which which females usually use.

509
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:47.460
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They would be very willing to use them, they would be very willing to use them and, and if you could just make it more compact.

510
01:05:48.210 --> 01:06:01.410
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Not just a headband but just a few leads near to just above your ears actually search devices are also available it's not that we would need a new invention and headband easy devices are also already available.

511
01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.790
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So if if the our device had.

512
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:19.800
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: easy to connecting devices more compact, they would be more willing to use it more more of the time, so this will also among the 80% of people who did not have an imperative, yes, so.

513
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.020
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To give an overall conclusion of our survey Florian.

514
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:42.150
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We would be would be happy, saying that we had a positive response and we've got a motivation to move ahead on our idea but okay before elaborating on that, I would like to show some feedback which we received.

515
01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.660
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: From our service objects.

516
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:50.580
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: First of all, our our APP our system.

517
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:59.700
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Was novel to know was novel to them, and some of them had only seen them in SCI fi movies.

518
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:22.650
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: That written some novels but but Davis men very much excited to see a possibility of it in their life and a few of us are a few of the subjects believe that more than more than normal people are mentally mentally sick patients who have been diagnosed with mental illness.

519
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.910
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: They could be more targeted towards them.

520
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:30.690
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: And some of the people.

521
01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:46.230
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: As some of the people were just not interested in knowing the emotional level like they simply did not care there's some people will also the Burton these people were.

522
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.250
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Mostly among that sexual operation which had never used.

523
01:07:51.390 --> 01:08:01.620
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Any smartwatch or they have a they had never seen any closed ones, using any smart watch any smart device device taking the party function parameters.

524
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:14.940
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To try some important feedbacks where the flow yeah they suggested that we can in the later on, we can modify our system to be also targeted towards.

525
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:21.870
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: middle aged people who are suffering from lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, because lifestyle diseases are also.

526
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:33.390
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Very much coordinated and linked to the emotional states, those who are suffering from anger issues, though those are suffering from anxiety, they have been shown.

527
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:44.940
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: To have high incidence rates of hypertension and other lifestyle disease so later on in future, we might have a focused towards them and.

528
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.830
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: On.

529
01:08:48.420 --> 01:09:08.010
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The apart, apart from that, the overwhelming feedback was was towards taking the step to make our headband headband more compact more compact or more blending towards the normal us like blending it in a cab or in a head.

530
01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:21.330
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: In our CAP or in a hat or in here band it's females us so that they will be able to use it in the outdoors to well doing the other activities so.

531
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.090
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Overall flow yeah I would.

532
01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:35.070
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: I would like to say that we got a largely positive response and it gave us enough motivation to move forward with our idea and.

533
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.500
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So what we are planning ahead is to.

534
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.130
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Have so so basically steps basically steps which we which I would like to enumerate.

535
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:50.490
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We should take forward ahead is.

536
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:59.970
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We should test we should test with the basic premise of our idea with an easy with a portable EG device that is a headband.

537
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:13.470
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Which is as of now, which is as of now, not available in the lab of ECU of power ECR I have already visited our lab and we checked all the.

538
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:25.770
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: instruments already available, but as of now, it is not yet available there, however, we check the prices and all it was not not very costly fortunately so.

539
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:33.090
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Once we once we have our we once we have that device, we can move on.

540
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:34.530
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: With.

541
01:10:35.670 --> 01:11:00.180
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: starting the testing is starting the testing on volunteers subjects and really relating it with the EG with the ej study with the emotional data, and we would be Designing an APP which will be which will be analyzing the ej study of the person.

542
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:09.150
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: With the emotional state and giving them the desert and, accordingly, giving them suggestions to what they should do in real time.

543
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:18.300
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: According to passion to improve their emotional state, so we know Florian this is to make it fully commercial fully commercial.

544
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:27.120
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: This could become a very large project to be implement implemented by a very big corporation, but our aim initially is to make it.

545
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:38.670
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: At the scale of a PLC a proof of concept to make it function, make it functional at a very basic right now, here, and I think.

546
01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:59.820
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: I think we have a strong belief that you would be able to do so and we have enough skills and opportunities to do so, too, and this idea, this basic concept has a very long way to go, in future, we believe, so floria and yeah so so now we're open to your questions and your feedback.

547
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:01.950
Florian Wahl: Okay.

548
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.800
Florian Wahl: thanks for the presentation so again.

549
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.340
Florian Wahl: Can we go back to the POP shops.

550
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:15.000
Shailly Upadhyay: That will say either yeah I mean again.

551
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:29.490
Florian Wahl: So you have to really be careful with these things police in the future so with the bar chart there was.

552
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:40.950
Florian Wahl: There was one mistake that there was both parts of the basketball 100% and also, I think, how many people did you interview.

553
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.860
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: 15,000,050.

554
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.610
Florian Wahl: Because the numbers were a little bit.

555
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.470
Florian Wahl: suspicious near well rounded.

556
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:55.200
Florian Wahl: Either around us.

557
01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.620
Florian Wahl: yeah I don't know it's a bit strange that, out of.

558
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:03.930
Florian Wahl: yeah anyway.

559
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:06.780
Florian Wahl: it's interesting besides.

560
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:15.510
Florian Wahl: I still think that before you experiment with the hardware, you should really looking to the issue of motion artifacts.

561
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:20.760
Florian Wahl: Because with EG I think this might be quite.

562
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.270
Florian Wahl: difficult.

563
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:34.290
Florian Wahl: And then the other question would be how is the idea that you buy some that the laptop by some hardware or.

564
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:40.050
Shailly Upadhyay: yeah we are planning to like to arrange some sort of a sensor.

565
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:44.730
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay yeah yeah that was part of our agenda today for.

566
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.820
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Our discussion our presentation.

567
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.240
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: We like to move ahead with a request to you if we could talk to.

568
01:13:55.590 --> 01:14:13.470
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: pj device can our lab in his era cause to have to have our team Members, we are already infiltration and we did visit the lab last week and we talked to Danny the lab in charge, India, we went to all the available devices yet.

569
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:16.590
Florian Wahl: mm hmm um.

570
01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:26.130
Florian Wahl: So i'm the only one that's not working and calculation so maybe dominic can give you some feedback on that.

571
01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:37.230
Florian Wahl: i'm not sure Have you looked around if there are what devices would be interesting for that so maybe that would be a good next step to.

572
01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.760
Florian Wahl: look into what devices could be bought for this purpose.

573
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.380
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah yeah yeah.

574
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:45.210
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The date longer.

575
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:56.820
Florian Wahl: So maybe you can put like your top three or top five together, in a word, file or some kind of document with the price or something, but by it.

576
01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.000
Florian Wahl: Around and then yeah, as I said, please investigate this issue of.

577
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:16.110
Florian Wahl: Of motion artifacts because I think this will be quite critical and kind of think about whether you want to constrain yourself to recording institute or et in.

578
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:25.050
Florian Wahl: exceeded conversations or throughout the entire day because I think that would be quite tricky.

579
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:36.840
Naina: yeah actually like Florian like when we have visited so it's like we have checked, most of the senses over there, the devices.

580
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:48.930
Naina: But actually which we are requiring that was not existing there so thing is like Vietnam to the numerator so we told like if your project is a true you get a.

581
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:56.610
Naina: lead from your supervisor so, then we can think about it, even if we have to go not so it's like.

582
01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:13.170
Naina: from you, before like if it is approved, then we can really go ahead with this so like, as you know, like we really have the limited time also until June and July, so we can put together all the sensors and devices and the top players is a spreadsheet and we can provide you.

583
01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:23.880
Naina: More can give our feedback and my freakin move ahead with this island if the university can provide a standard, and we can really start with the things.

584
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.350
Florian Wahl: That.

585
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:40.470
Florian Wahl: Maybe I think dominic we've watched a video so he I think can give you feedback on that, but I think what would be a good starting point is to have this kind of all of your what hardware, you really need.

586
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.900
Florian Wahl: And what a cost of that is whether that's like 500 euros or 5000 euros or.

587
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.650
No.

588
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.130
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: No, no, no, no, show and that.

589
01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:02.610
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The devices which we went to it was just verlander around 200 euros also.

590
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.900
Florian Wahl: Okay yeah.

591
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:11.370
Naina: we're not sure we check the emotion devices not around that I think sort of you know.

592
01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:18.390
Florian Wahl: Just just write it up and maybe come back next week and then we discuss it next.

593
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.940
Florian Wahl: Next week there's no lecture but in two weeks.

594
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:30.060
Naina: Is it not possible Florian to do this week, if we can have a friendly thing because it's all about the ordering and these things takes time actually.

595
01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:32.850
Florian Wahl: yeah Maybe you can.

596
01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.920
Florian Wahl: So I don't know what dominic's responses, because I don't want a population, so I don't know.

597
01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:42.600
Florian Wahl: I mean.

598
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.990
Florian Wahl: Who will pay for that there.

599
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:57.630
Florian Wahl: But maybe you can send around some an email with some links and the hardware that that you would like to have, and then I can discuss with dominic.

600
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:09.270
Florian Wahl: Okay, any other questions.

601
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.660
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Surely the side with questions.

602
01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.110
Shailly Upadhyay: The feedback one.

603
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.050
Shailly Upadhyay: I think I haven't had any questions.

604
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.570
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, no, this was the slides, and yet the slide with questions I was talking about.

605
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:53.940
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay yeah so anyone that thing you pointed out videos is around out did you round up the survey results yeah we did round up because a few of the answers were unequivocal.

606
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:58.290
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: A few of the answers on it people, so we did is owned up.

607
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:07.470
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: The services a little bit and yeah So the question, we would like to ask you Julian.

608
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:12.780
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Apart from to clean the device and moving ahead with the device.

609
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:17.280
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: What would you suggest, we should take an immediate next step.

610
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:22.680
Florian Wahl: I would.

611
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:33.000
Florian Wahl: think that even without the device, but you can do is do some research on emotional recognition from you cheated i'm sure there's some articles.

612
01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.450
Florian Wahl: articles on that yeah.

613
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.420
Florian Wahl: And maybe prepare a nice overview on that.

614
01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:46.170
Florian Wahl: So yeah kind of what kind of emotions were recognized, what was the device use what were the sampling frequencies.

615
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:50.790
Florian Wahl: yeah I think that could be a good overview to do that.

616
01:19:52.170 --> 01:20:00.180
Florian Wahl: With like 10 or 20 articles because i'm sure there's a lot of these articles on the topic and pre research this.

617
01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:06.810
Florian Wahl: The martian artifact issue, because I know that we today that's that's really an issue.

618
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:17.100
Florian Wahl: And then think about where you want to position the sensor, so I think this is global electrodes or How does that work.

619
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.490
Florian Wahl: And then you need to check whether you need to put some liquid on this electrodes.

620
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.280
Florian Wahl: And then, how long does it last how long can you record and then think about a.

621
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:40.530
Florian Wahl: Maybe the next So the first step was really, really be like a thorough literature review and then after that I think the next step is to come up with some kind of study protocol so you have to think about.

622
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:56.520
Florian Wahl: What does your study look like how many participants, do you want to record what is the schedule there, so what kind of activities, how do you kind of provoke maybe different emotions, so I think.

623
01:20:59.190 --> 01:20:59.520
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: yeah.

624
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.210
Florian Wahl: yeah you have to you have to think about that.

625
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:17.880
Florian Wahl: How do you record ground truth, how do you calibrate the system, and so on, this is quite so I think it's a fun the literature review, you might get a good idea of how this can be done.

626
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:18.570
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: So that.

627
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.530
Florian Wahl: That might be to the experiment assignment be also a good next step.

628
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:31.110
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay, he yeah That would be a very nice idea to go ahead as the immediate interested, thank you for the for the idea.

629
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:35.040
Florian Wahl: Okay, then, is there any more questions.

630
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:38.310
Saurabh Swaroop’s iPad: Okay equation Australia.

631
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:42.300
Shailly Upadhyay: From my side, no thanks for the feedback.

632
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:45.060
Florian Wahl: yeah you're welcome Okay, then.

633
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:48.240
Florian Wahl: I will end this.

634
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:56.160
Florian Wahl: This I will leave the session, I think I can give the host to someone maybe.

635
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:04.170
Florian Wahl: Emily I will make you host and you can hand this over to boost it and said okay.

636
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:17.670
Florian Wahl: Well idina I will, I will make you host and when was he comes in just you can give him okay thanks.

637
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.770
Edina Larios: I am not sure if that's the best idea because.

638
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:23.790
Edina Larios: All about to.

639
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:27.510
Edina Larios: me.

640
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:28.950
Gaurang Thanekar: I will be here because i'll be.

641
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:32.100
Florian Wahl: Your host.

642
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:35.160
Florian Wahl: Two weeks.

643
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.170
Edina Larios: bye thanks bye bye.

644
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:38.610
Shailly Upadhyay: Thank you bye bye.

645
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.330
Mouzhi Ge: Recording.

646
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:31.920
Mouzhi Ge: I heard the recording in progress already.

647
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:43.080
Mouzhi Ge: And so, from your side, let me share the screen the bed to see here on the hook on to the presentation and here's the team's.

648
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.000
Not teams.

649
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.850
So more.

650
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.500
shares.

651
01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:58.620
here.

652
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:03.420
Mouzhi Ge: So, this would be the teams.

653
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:10.980
Mouzhi Ge: From my side and let's go for team by team and before that.

654
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.310
Mouzhi Ge: not sure if I mentioned and problem to some of you guys are now joining my last lecture.

655
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:31.350
Mouzhi Ge: And I put some questions in the in the in the ir over there and I would like to to, I would like, I would like to see a bit more technical details.

656
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:45.150
Mouzhi Ge: If you can but anyway, if you didn't prepare that totally okay for the lack totally okay for the for the presentation and i'm going to ask those kind of questions later and after the whole recording.

657
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:51.750
Mouzhi Ge: Okay, for for this one, for the first one impossible, is nothing and the whole will.

658
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:53.610
Mouzhi Ge: present.

659
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.190
Mouzhi Ge: Anybody will present on this one.

660
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:07.800
Mouzhi Ge: Is there anybody from this planet.

661
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.170
Mouzhi Ge: or he's already presented.

662
01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:12.090
Mouzhi Ge: not sure on that.

663
01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:14.310
Alfa Nwanonobi: We are you good.

664
01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:19.350
OSARODION OHENZUWA: We we are, we are ready.

665
01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:21.720
Mouzhi Ge: yeah go on go on.

666
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.760
Mouzhi Ge: My screen, so can you share the screen yeah.

667
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:30.960
Alfa Nwanonobi: Could you would that.

668
01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:46.800
Mouzhi Ge: make you a Co host let me see if I make the Co host make you a Co host I think you should be able to share the screen okay.

669
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:09.450
Mouzhi Ge: yeah please go on.

670
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:12.840
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Okay, so our group name impossible, is nothing.

671
01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:15.390
OSARODION OHENZUWA: short.

672
01:33:16.710 --> 01:33:18.420
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Of the sasquatch infection.

673
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:32.520
OSARODION OHENZUWA: So talked about inspiration, as with the hospitals clinics this slide is in pain, if you make it in this ratio, as the mosquitoes clinics could be the solution in your needs.

674
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:39.600
OSARODION OHENZUWA: and stick with us internist and physicians surgeons nurses patients.

675
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:42.960
OSARODION OHENZUWA: misled, if anything, the.

676
01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:44.910
OSARODION OHENZUWA: slideshow.

677
01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:51.150
OSARODION OHENZUWA: So our point of view.

678
01:33:52.770 --> 01:33:55.650
OSARODION OHENZUWA: We we modified our points of view of time in the missing.

679
01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:04.260
OSARODION OHENZUWA: it's missing Amina so our points of views and family physicians house Esther.

680
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:14.220
OSARODION OHENZUWA: need a way to accurately predict patients who have for ability of developing long covered right from the first day of clinical presentation in the hospital.

681
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:25.140
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And this is because it's significant proportion of fusco with patients to suffer from life debilitating could be related morbidity after acute treatment okay next slide please.

682
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:41.220
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And then, as original with much they were trying to define a clinical parameters or criteria for potential screen upgrading and also retrieve data from probably scientific articles and then the length of it websites.

683
01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:43.050
OSARODION OHENZUWA: insolent this.

684
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:48.300
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Yes, okay we'll check that a business like pubmed Google scholar.

685
01:34:49.350 --> 01:35:02.400
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And also, we reviewed case studies clinical case studies nuts and optimistic in this is OK, and then they also the water to organization and statistical reporting period 19 we also checked that's their business like.

686
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:17.220
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Okay, now we also had them Okay, and we conducted interview, and we asked him doctors is a house and some questions festival for the understood by the concepts in long covered.

687
01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:29.850
OSARODION OHENZUWA: If there are any problems or issues arising from either the prevention, diagnosis, treatment or management of this condition and what areas of improvement, the clinic Al Qaeda would suggest in the aspect of non compete next question.

688
01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:38.220
OSARODION OHENZUWA: We also ask them if they had any idea of puts on how these programs could be addressed, how we could not efficient at an increased risk of covered.

689
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:48.210
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And what's their opinion was a Baltistan a scoring system for prediction of long of it and also business and the commercial value and we realized that.

690
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:55.980
OSARODION OHENZUWA: The majority of them actually didn't know the concept called long long curve, it would say when patient had discovered.

691
01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.220
OSARODION OHENZUWA: symptoms after treatment and they come back, they just treat the symptoms and when majority of them were open to the idea of.

692
01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:11.850
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Having a scoring system that could help them easily know this patient right from the physio of presentation, if you have the clinic in covert states or not.

693
01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:26.400
OSARODION OHENZUWA: So they can share their clinic appointment and then after waiter a lot of articles and literature reviews and also a withdrew make our case studies were able to isolate them six per click or parameters.

694
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:37.170
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Now we now we can start recording this image in patients with non covered the age of the patient, the agenda in number of symptoms, in the first week of diagnosis, the body mass index.

695
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:45.480
OSARODION OHENZUWA: The prayers of associated comorbidities and the vaccination status, this is also synonymous, is to to study conducted by them Swiss.

696
01:36:46.530 --> 01:37:05.190
OSARODION OHENZUWA: institutes in Zurich and in which they developed a similar scoring system called packs but they usually be each the symptoms are tests we pray ish history of asthma and the Prince of co-morbidities so now, the first criteria at the age of the patient.

697
01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:20.310
OSARODION OHENZUWA: me study conducted by should read i'll UK study published in 2021 say that patient 9% of 9.9% of patient how long can we delay is between 18 and 4049 years.

698
01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:30.000
OSARODION OHENZUWA: 15.9% of patients, where is between 50 and 69 is way too into what we may be sent to flunk of efficient way is about 70 years.

699
01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:43.080
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And this equivalent to mathematical ratio of one to 1.5 to two and there we go ahead and pitch in between it's you know 40 years with a quality score of one point.

700
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:54.540
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Those from 50 to 69 years were given a score 1.5 points, and those are both 70 years we scored two points based on this criteria, please emptiness late.

701
01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:10.080
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And then the gender of the patient and why some studies reported our closest statistical significant significant difference in Jeddah among sufficient, but a study discovered a majority of this patient we said to be females.

702
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:20.850
OSARODION OHENZUWA: It disproportionately affected females, and then 14.9% of them were famous compared to what you're saying yeah and in fact the sense of meals had long coffee.

703
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:40.200
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And this corresponds to the ratio of 1.5 to one and so more like a being a female the risk will say to have increased by 50% and so female patient way to given this coven Point five points, whether they're male counterparts at what is called a single points nestle.

704
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:49.650
OSARODION OHENZUWA: The number of systems to the festival, this was a world most statistical significance significance in points and then about 10 symptoms.

705
01:38:50.340 --> 01:39:07.890
OSARODION OHENZUWA: were isolated take almost symptoms and if a patient has five or more of these symptoms it's it's it's proteins is strong game and prognosis of having uncovered the range from fatigue headaches common symptoms, we have all heard about the cove Chesapeake Bay area so on.

706
01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:27.090
OSARODION OHENZUWA: In the study conducted by cigarette i'll the odds ratio for each particular symptom predicting long covered bridge from one to for an average of 2.5 for females, while its range from 0.5 to 4.5 and average of seems similar average for meals.

707
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:39.810
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And Wendy Wendy odds ratio for patient having at least five of these symptoms, was it was calculated in this study its range from three to 5.5 an average of 4.3 females next slide please.

708
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:49.770
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Thank you, and its range from 2.5 to six on average of 4.25 million meals and taking both averages as your ratio in 2.5.

709
01:39:50.310 --> 01:40:02.490
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Throughout the ratio of 4.3 who are fit ratio of one to 1.7 approximately one to two, so this states that's efficient having five or more symptoms.

710
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:14.130
OSARODION OHENZUWA: The risk of having local means increased 100% complete or somebody having less than five symptoms so they're giving you score one where does have you ever given this quote so next thing.

711
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:17.640
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And the body mass index.

712
01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:27.990
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Most of this report that the trend that majority of this patient or how long of a good way overweight or obese having at least a body mass index of 25.0 kilograms per meter squared.

713
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:38.250
OSARODION OHENZUWA: In a study conducted by we give him a cut it all published in 2021 on on healthcare workers, and most of a 50 51% of lankov.

714
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:38.820
Alfa Nwanonobi: Efficient.

715
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.380
OSARODION OHENZUWA: How the BMI both students that point zero and this and the p value of 0.020.

716
01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:57.420
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Which is statistically significant and so, hence patients will be a minus 3508 giving a score of one, why does above to a temporary zero be given a score two points nestle.

717
01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:04.410
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Yes, the fifth clicker parameter was the presence of other comorbidities of.

718
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:14.280
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Two studies isolated that's the first study said in chronic embrace Richard disease, they 2.3% of patient our local.

719
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:35.040
OSARODION OHENZUWA: symptoms and had a history of respiratory disease are 4% of them had that two diabetes about three points of his head had his stroke high potential and the most common in women had history of mental illness prop to the to the in sickness in another study.

720
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:39.600
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Craig respiratory disease 9.5%.

721
01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:47.010
OSARODION OHENZUWA: of them had have longer efficient heart disease, and then the p value of 0.007 which is, which is.

722
01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:59.880
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Statistically significant, and this was observed in about one SEC more efficient so i'm looking at this, so hey, especially with no comorbidities were given a score of one.

723
01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:09.480
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And then missions, having non respiratory comorbidities, for example, type to DM hypertension mentor in this were saying the score 1.5.

724
01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:20.280
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Why patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases like asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease obstructive sleep apnea syndromes with given a score two points and.

725
01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:39.000
OSARODION OHENZUWA: yeah so okay next slide please and then Alaska anchor points, the first initial status in a study conducted by your balcony at all published recently about four weeks ago, which was reported a patient who had who had at least to complete it could be 19 vaccine disease.

726
01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:50.700
OSARODION OHENZUWA: about what he did today no specifically by the type of coordinating by symbol, so they had a 41.9% decrease in the also have been known.

727
01:42:51.570 --> 01:43:01.500
OSARODION OHENZUWA: to him only 9.9% of them actually had long could be compared to 14.6% of similar participants now fascinated I had no could be.

728
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:21.750
OSARODION OHENZUWA: So, looking at this ratio wise, it was a one to 1.5 so so we're able to do that, not having coordinating vaccine increases the chance of having long cookie by 50% so this means that vascular patient has got one on backseat efficient we scored 1.5 so this.

729
01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.780
OSARODION OHENZUWA: is customary.

730
01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:39.840
OSARODION OHENZUWA: For the edge, as I said before, just to recap it into 4949 years we give you one point 50 to 69 1.5 points above or equal to 72.4 the agenda females was called 1.5 points meals you single point.

731
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:48.600
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Number six in the face trick less i'm facing terms it's called the point and greater or equal to facing in terms it's called coupons looks like this.

732
01:43:50.100 --> 01:44:01.920
OSARODION OHENZUWA: For the body mass index and people have been less than 10 5.0 kilograms per meter squared is called one points and those have been at least two and 510 kilograms per meter squared we scored two points.

733
01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:12.270
OSARODION OHENZUWA: and praying so for our Karma with his absence of any comorbidities like any past in there, we give you one points and brains of non respiratory comorbidities.

734
01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:21.930
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Including tied to DM high potential cardiac disease may that in is your kidney disease in isn't easy I put it on esoteric, and this was because.

735
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:33.000
OSARODION OHENZUWA: It was, it was not the phoenix are some studies discovered that people that have chronic kidney disease had an increased chance of having long covered why some studies disputed that so.

736
01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:43.500
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And then Prince of chronic respiratory diseases, for example at smart, especially in chronicles for constructive pulmonary disease and obviously partner syndrome had two points.

737
01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:53.730
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And then the last point first initial status, those are vaccinated taking at least to do this with quality points and those that are not completely fascinated are given 1.5 points.

738
01:44:54.390 --> 01:45:09.390
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And now we use these criteria, as I said before they see this a Swiss scientists are Zurich and walked on this and then last year they probably realistic calculator that could help to estimate these what they worked on just four criteria each.

739
01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:18.720
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Pretty number of sequence, in the first week and history of asthma and also the impressive immunoglobulin these are chemicals are miserable.

740
01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:28.500
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And we discover that in order to make it more easy for some patients to us yeah so that is no it's just strictly for physicians and now item petition.

741
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:47.340
OSARODION OHENZUWA: As you can observe that all the scoring parameters have at least a score of 1.2 there's No zero points yeah so does it, so the minimum score achievable is actually six points and the maximum score achievable is 11 points and then use it using the scoring system and also.

742
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:52.680
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Trying to compare with what was released last year by histories institute's.

743
01:45:53.790 --> 01:46:01.860
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Fishing scoring less than seven points were assigned the nordics nordics and value those heavy from seven to 7.5 points had my risk.

744
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:13.020
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And those as cause from a 3.5 we had the moderate risk of having long of it and those have been at least nine points Heidi see various coffee no coffee that most likely.

745
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:24.390
OSARODION OHENZUWA: yeah we're talking about we're talking briefly about the business model we plan to him in developing the mobile APP downloaded the mobile APP.

746
01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:30.300
OSARODION OHENZUWA: which can be downloaded from Google play store for android users and also the apple store for iPhone users.

747
01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:38.760
OSARODION OHENZUWA: And, thereby making this up not only accessible to physicians or healthcare workers, but also to curious patients who love to know the oreck scoring.

748
01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:49.650
OSARODION OHENZUWA: system, as you can see the parameters anybody can actually use anybody that has covered can actually use these parameters, we can answer actually answer the questions on scholarship.

749
01:46:50.220 --> 01:47:02.910
OSARODION OHENZUWA: Is practical yeah That would be a basic plan for non paying users and it will be attached to just three attempts or trails of the so the scoring system that will be for the basic plan which will be free in SF this.

750
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:13.080
OSARODION OHENZUWA: is for the premium plan, these are people that will be subscribers are decided paying customers and especially only limited as it can be for multiple operations.

751
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:25.680
OSARODION OHENZUWA: For those are not yet convinced of the usefulness of this APP will put a seven day free trial for them, and only limited access and I thought that they can decide if they're going to pay for this.

752
01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:41.880
OSARODION OHENZUWA: association could either be weekly two years monthly several years yearly it's a years depending on individual diesel preference our APP is also open for commercial advertisement by brands and marketers as an admin so have riven nestle.

753
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.680
OSARODION OHENZUWA: yeah it's why references yeah listening.

754
01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:50.550
OSARODION OHENZUWA: yeah misled.

755
01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:59.670
OSARODION OHENZUWA: yeah Thank you it's like oh yeah this step is to design, it puts with a for the clinical application yeah i'm a Python.

756
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:03.030
OSARODION OHENZUWA: API could, thank you very much.

757
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.410
Mouzhi Ge: Thanks a lot.

758
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.260
Mouzhi Ge: Thanks, let me pause the recording, then we can go for the next one.

759
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:13.740
yeah.

760
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.470
Elisa Julia: You can see my screen right.

761
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:18.090
Mouzhi Ge: yeah I can see that Thank you.

762
01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:30.030
Elisa Julia: Yes, so we are the colored wires and yeah, so this is our the presentation over a second sprint and the first thing I wanted to mention is what we're actually trying to do.

763
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:36.900
Elisa Julia: So we've had some meetings within ourselves, and also with the health of future and we.

764
01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:49.590
Elisa Julia: define a bit more our challenge, and we will or at this, we will try, but the challenge is to develop a plugin to allow live virtual consultation directly from the platform between the patient and the doctors.

765
01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:58.500
Elisa Julia: And these should be video, so this is also we refined it after our meeting with me philomena, so this is already getting feedback.

766
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.660
Elisa Julia: So the communication should be spontaneous and the direction also lives.

767
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:15.810
Elisa Julia: The there's a lot of data generated during the console which also should be included in the patient sales, so there must be a communication between the plugin are our extension and the platform.

768
01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:33.150
Elisa Julia: Doctors can proposals from the calendar, and this is a proposal that philomena and made and which was to integrated with Dr live, which is what they're doing right now, until we don't plan to create a new calendar just to allow them to do it directly with have to live.

769
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:43.080
Elisa Julia: And and yeah so as a fan point is, we are not really mainly because of time restrictions, we are won't be working on.

770
01:49:44.550 --> 01:50:00.180
Elisa Julia: Regulatory we won't be really focusing on that of course we'll take a look at that, but mainly data protection, and we are some other topics may not be covered to what we are trying to achieve is just a functional plugin that allows the visual presentation.

771
01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:11.160
Elisa Julia: Okay, then what we did during this sprint we did the clinical research in a second rational will give it some some of the summaries.

772
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:20.820
Elisa Julia: And we had a first meeting with philomena which was really helpful because we define everything that we wanted to, or at least the first questions that we had.

773
01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:34.710
Elisa Julia: We talked about what she was interested in what are some ideas that we thought of but we're actually not very interesting and we started creating also our report to structure some ideas.

774
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:43.950
Elisa Julia: And then we are still working on a first project with family with health future, so this is also something I think will always be in progress.

775
01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:53.700
Elisa Julia: We got the approval from philomena to create an account to get to know the platform as a patient so that's something that we're doing at the moment.

776
01:50:55.110 --> 01:51:03.600
Elisa Julia: We are also doing market research and technology news so in the next sprint will be focusing mainly on these two on market research and technology.

777
01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:15.600
Elisa Julia: We are basically trying to find what technologies are available, but it would be also easier for us because we don't have that much experience with these type of technologies.

778
01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:21.300
Elisa Julia: Then there's my can you explain the refining.

779
01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:22.170
yeah.

780
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:39.150
Reshma: Can you just move to that next line yeah so we basically the the medical research part regarding long cord so long car, it is not when can we call something as long.

781
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:51.060
Reshma: As when the symptoms of code versus appear more even after four weeks of the first onset of board 90 so that's when we call it long code.

782
01:51:51.540 --> 01:52:02.040
Reshma: And there's a wide range of symptoms from respiratory symptoms to neurological symptoms, so the main major symptoms that we see are fatigue.

783
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:16.590
Reshma: And shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction So these are the three major symptoms PC and but other than that there are a lot of small symptoms like hair loss and things like that.

784
01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:19.230
Reshma: We go to the next slide.

785
01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:25.590
Reshma: yeah and the possible causes of long code.

786
01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:47.700
Reshma: Since it's a very new thing researchers are still going on, regarding this, but there have been some possibilities that the researchers have suggested is that there's permanent fiber optic armory changes occurring in the lungs, so this could be one reason and another reason could be.

787
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:58.620
Reshma: For the heart patients are developing any cardiology codes in terms of that myocardial changes for permanent changes are occurring.

788
01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:13.230
Reshma: Such as persistent myocarditis that could be another reason and again another possibility is that possibility of developing auto antibodies So these are auto antibodies are fighting against our.

789
01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:17.700
Reshma: system, so these could be the reasons and.

790
01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:20.850
Reshma: The possible risk factors.

791
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:34.650
Reshma: it's The main reason the main risk factors at one stage, so people over 70 years are seen to develop more symptoms compared to young patients, then.

792
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:37.500
Reshma: Pre existing conditions like.

793
01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:47.790
Reshma: Any diabetes, or any other diseases, these could add to the scene and then viral load so in the initial weeks of.

794
01:53:48.810 --> 01:54:00.180
Reshma: code 90 when a person is infected if they have a higher viral load, this could be a reason for the person to dial up long cord and females are seem to have.

795
01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:11.820
Reshma: To develop long call it TAO chance of developing log or 10 meals, then I experiencing more than five in terms of the first weeks of illness, this is another reason.

796
01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:22.830
Reshma: Any pain when any patient Dallas more than five symptoms, in the first week of illness, the person could develop have a higher chance of developing logo.

797
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.320
Reshma: Next name.

798
01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:51.000
Reshma: yeah so the diagnosing the long corridor, so the diagnosis is based on the different systems that are affected so for someone with a pre existing dimittis condition the diagnosing off, it would be different from someone else who has maybe COPD so.

799
01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:59.130
Reshma: Basically, depends on the pre existing conditions and other than that mainly it's the.

800
01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:11.820
Reshma: chest X Ray and sometimes a CT scan all these other major diagnostic tools, so in our platform also, we would like to.

801
01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:20.160
Reshma: When we download the platform, we are thinking of developing, something in which we can share the.

802
01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:24.090
Reshma: The doctors can share the X rays and.

803
01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:27.540
Reshma: CT scans and all that.

804
01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:29.700
Reshma: Next slide.

805
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:35.040
Reshma: yeah, these are all the desk could you go to the next, please.

806
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:37.710
Reshma: yeah.

807
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:47.130
Reshma: So, as I said earlier, like a competent comprehensive evaluation as needed.

808
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:49.980
Reshma: like to note.

809
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.790
Reshma: to predict accurate diagnosis.

810
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.310
Reshma: The next slide.

811
01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:12.660
Reshma: yeah and interdisciplinary crossover so mainly it's neurology cardiology and phonology, these are the main speciality, is that we are trying to incorporate.

812
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:20.970
Reshma: yeah and that's I carefully also comes into play with regard to long covered.

813
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:23.310
Reshma: Next slide please.

814
01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:39.690
Reshma: Yes, how long does the condition of long college last so studies are still going on and there's no definite answer to this question, but it could, but the studies prove that could go up to even a year or more than that.

815
01:56:41.610 --> 01:56:42.450
Reshma: Next slide.

816
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:45.870
Reshma: yeah and.

817
01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:53.940
Reshma: The the PR the patients who have been vaccinated have a much lesser chance of developing post forward.

818
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:56.910
Reshma: Some purpose coordinating syndrome.

819
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:00.450
Reshma: Next slide.

820
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:10.350
Reshma: yeah long covered treatment it's also mainly depending on the type of.

821
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:24.060
Reshma: Depending on the systems that are affected so and it's also symptomatic treatment that's given so for each individual the interdisciplinary therapy has needed.

822
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:30.030
Reshma: It depends on the pre existing condition, as well as the security of the code episode.

823
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:46.140
Reshma: So some of the methods of long code rehabilitation are given our spirit with physiotherapy physical training physical measures to go directly psycho education neurological nationals.

824
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:48.840
Reshma: Next slide.

825
01:57:51.810 --> 01:57:53.490
Reshma: Now that's basically.

826
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:59.400
Mouzhi Ge: Thank you very much, let me pause the recording.

827
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:05.790
Marian Esskaros: Are you recording that.

828
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:08.430
Mouzhi Ge: Recording that should I stop.

829
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:09.900
Marian Esskaros: No that's fine.

830
01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.100
Mouzhi Ge: Okay yeah i'm just yeah starts to push the recording box and just now yeah.

831
01:58:14.610 --> 01:58:15.960
Mouzhi Ge: Go ahead and take our time.

832
01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:18.210
Mouzhi Ge: I can see the screen on.

833
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.360
Mouzhi Ge: Your yeah I.

834
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:26.130
Mouzhi Ge: know not yet not yet is loading.

835
01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.980
Mouzhi Ge: Now I can perfect.

836
01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:30.840
Marian Esskaros: Okay.

837
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:34.980
Marian Esskaros: So continuing of our last presentation about how to.

838
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:39.750
Marian Esskaros: prioritize our problems, we also and the psychology and mental health problem.

839
01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:58.890
Marian Esskaros: But we didn't yeah we also voted for that so basically we have four main problems that we were a little bit stuck in the last minute to decide which problem should we go through or tackle because we contacted.

840
01:59:00.330 --> 01:59:07.710
Marian Esskaros: yeah we tried to contact them and we have developers like sheila and stuff but we didn't receive a response, so we actually couldn't.

841
01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:12.600
Marian Esskaros: make an appointment with her or within a week teams so.

842
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:28.500
Marian Esskaros: We just based ourself on our votes our mindsets to discuss which problem of this Rebecca a yeah and we agreed on this nice problem.

843
01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:46.740
Marian Esskaros: So why we did not agree on other problems, because with an s tackling is a bit challenging and records professionals such as psychologist psychologist so the visibility aspect will not be.

844
01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:49.140
Marian Esskaros: will not be.

845
01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:50.790
Marian Esskaros: reached.

846
01:59:51.900 --> 02:00:09.690
Marian Esskaros: In that problem regarding the other problem which had a high score that a lot of competitors markets are already in the problem of forget to give medications and it can also be solved by some alarm so.

847
02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:16.710
Marian Esskaros: The vulnerability aspect will actually will not be reached, also in that.

848
02:00:17.190 --> 02:00:23.040
Marian Esskaros: problem also regarding the lack of knowledge of medicines will require us to take all the knowledge from Google.

849
02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:36.810
Marian Esskaros: Evaluating it making sure that it's accurate and put it into the APP so they don't have to go through 1000 pages on Facebook, so it can be a PhD product because we don't have much time in that yeah and.

850
02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.500
Marian Esskaros: Why did we choose our problem, like.

851
02:00:41.610 --> 02:00:53.010
Marian Esskaros: yeah what's our problem is to make a community for caregivers it's still like a Facebook or clubhouse or something like that.

852
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:58.080
Marian Esskaros: we're still in the beginning, we just defined the problem, so we don't actually have.

853
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.460
Marian Esskaros: A.

854
02:01:01.530 --> 02:01:03.240
Marian Esskaros: point of view of it so.

855
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:06.030
Marian Esskaros: yeah also it's.

856
02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:17.100
Marian Esskaros: Slightly easy to be implemented, as there are no much competitors in the market and that.

857
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:36.390
Marian Esskaros: We thought of a technical point of view, making a web based application for caregivers to share an ask for anything so they they actually can find the solution for other problems that we did not tackle like, for example, missing the medication and having mental problem.

858
02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:40.380
Marian Esskaros: And also.

859
02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:46.290
Marian Esskaros: Professionals like caregivers professionals like they are taking care of their.

860
02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:54.390
Marian Esskaros: family member, they can also apply for this application as experts so.

861
02:01:55.890 --> 02:01:58.890
Marian Esskaros: We can like have an option to ask an expert or something.

862
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.950
Marian Esskaros: yeah.

863
02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:17.280
Marian Esskaros: Our next step would be to make a prototype for the Web based application and we did not get that answers the questions we wanted to ask for she knew because we didn't meet her.

864
02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:22.980
Marian Esskaros: So we're still on on hold on that point.

865
02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:28.440
Marian Esskaros: yeah but no but and Johnson once is Bella.

866
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:32.340
Marian Esskaros: Someone from our team.

867
02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:33.840
Marian Esskaros: yeah.

868
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:49.110
Bella Ndaa: Okay hi everyone, so I would like to answer perfect Professor the professor's questions on island for for the Ai and data analysis part.

869
02:02:50.490 --> 02:03:07.110
Bella Ndaa: How would the data look like we're not sure, but it looks like it's going to be unstructured data i'm not sure for that one, the problem was answered programming language were using Python and ID most likely vs code.

870
02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:22.590
Bella Ndaa: Time line we are looking realistically are about 200 hours, but again we're not looking at completely deployed web application, if we can reach a prototype with.

871
02:03:23.670 --> 02:03:25.890
Bella Ndaa: usable functionality, that will be good.

872
02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:44.430
Bella Ndaa: data analysis, yes, we will have data analysis in terms of analyzing the data from, for example, what features, the users would like to have in the APP and then for after building some type of prototype there will be data analysis of how.

873
02:03:45.930 --> 02:03:52.440
Bella Ndaa: Like some type of feedback about the usability of the APP and the different features.

874
02:03:54.330 --> 02:03:55.350
Bella Ndaa: And then.

875
02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:03.180
Bella Ndaa: I think, does the part for Ai and data analysis I think i've answered all the different questions.

876
02:04:08.130 --> 02:04:12.450
Bella Ndaa: For for the ui we are looking at.

877
02:04:13.650 --> 02:04:23.580
Bella Ndaa: Something that is easier probably html and CSS i'm not sure, but see something that is easier to do and that could.

878
02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.850
Bella Ndaa: Give results easily.

879
02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:33.180
Bella Ndaa: And that's it, for my part, excellent.

880
02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.290
and

881
02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.170
Mouzhi Ge: that's the whole presentation are.

882
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:39.480
Bella Ndaa: yeah.

883
02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:39.960
Okay.

884
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:43.530
Mouzhi Ge: Perfect just a pause that.

885
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:56.700
Jubaida: So this is our team met phoenix our challenges medication management.

886
02:04:57.330 --> 02:05:06.630
Jubaida: So this is the overview of our elastic activists like he did in the last week, like as previously, we also do research and other things so.

887
02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:22.890
Jubaida: The last week we did more interferes with professional caregivers and social workers who were actually non professional caregivers but also conducted more research on existing solution application and we analyzed existing medication management tools.

888
02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:38.820
Jubaida: And the outcome from our last week activities that we actually took interview form for people to have them were professional caregivers and two of them were non professional caregivers they were actually social.

889
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:48.300
Jubaida: social workers so are the problems that told us that some patients will take medicine propel a sudden talks from people who have less memory.

890
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:59.700
Jubaida: communication with the gold edge patients difficulty in dealing patient to disabilities and less memory and difficulty in dealing with emergency situation so.

891
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:13.650
Jubaida: We also did maybe interviews previously and from all these, we decided to we have just came up into this says that we find out four main problems that.

892
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:19.980
Jubaida: will be going either any one of these like for psychological part some people were.

893
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:40.050
Jubaida: complaining about they were facing physical serious mental says so for the psychological particles caregiver suffer from mental stress and for educational part many people complain that there's like of information, knowledge, a potential solution and some caregivers don't.

894
02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:50.580
Jubaida: don't know about the medication at other stuff and for medication part can give us a feel for managing parameters of medication and.

895
02:06:51.330 --> 02:07:01.050
Jubaida: So many things and for sense of part some people so just just asked if we want to work on something, why not we work on sensor practical.

896
02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:08.850
Jubaida: caregivers want to know the body parameters for emergency need like the parameters of BP glucose monitoring and other things.

897
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:20.640
Jubaida: Like they can get the information of their patients by they're staying at their home so something that can be helpful for knowing that parameters of the patients.

898
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:25.950
Jubaida: And proposed solution that we think about for our problem.

899
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:35.940
Jubaida: We can build an application so we did research on application, there are many kinds of application their web application native application hybrid application.

900
02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:42.360
Jubaida: So we are not yet decided which one we're going to do, and we don't know who you are up to us.

901
02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:54.690
Jubaida: And also, from your feedback we need that info website, we don't know about that, and we also thought about two bucks so from your question.

902
02:07:55.170 --> 02:08:05.340
Jubaida: island are the programming language, we want to use like the person in our team knows Python and are the ID we.

903
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:18.600
Jubaida: know and we can use these are studio pie chart or our studio that data analytics or statistics part, we are not sure about we are we going to do the data analytics or statistics and for them.

904
02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:31.320
Jubaida: It would be great if we can keep it simple and we can keep it like Microsoft windows or android and the time, then I as our example station will be and on may six so.

905
02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:36.600
Jubaida: If we are going to build something that is from May to June 30.

906
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:47.460
Jubaida: And we have some question for you, if it is so to create an APP which one of the system for us within these pure habit on it, but or waiver, or what else you can.

907
02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:58.800
Jubaida: You can suggest us for weight side of it, the recommendation and for sensor wearable do we have to build that sense of ourselves, our else.

908
02:08:59.850 --> 02:09:00.480
Jubaida: Thank you.

909
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:08.400
Mouzhi Ge: pause the recording.

910
02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:27.330
Svetlana Semenova: So our goal for previous weeks for to analyze all the data and come up with several hypothesis that we can test.

911
02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:40.380
Svetlana Semenova: and discusses new way about the research and the projects and APP doing research for you, for publications the duration other sources explore current solutions that I exist on the market.

912
02:09:41.190 --> 02:09:53.760
Svetlana Semenova: ended our pov and if i'm authority authority, and so, in the end we have come up with these big statement so Robert who is 29 works as a caregiver.

913
02:09:54.420 --> 02:10:09.660
Svetlana Semenova: manage four to six patients each from 60 to 90 years old, needs a way to alleviate some of the pressure from trying to remember the timing move which medication for each patient and have access to useful information.

914
02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:13.500
Svetlana Semenova: So we have come up.

915
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:24.840
Svetlana Semenova: With several solutions for the problems that we had and we asked we conducted interviews again and we asked each of our.

916
02:10:25.890 --> 02:10:34.800
Svetlana Semenova: interviewee to create solutions and we provided from zero to 10 so we've come up with those.

917
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:46.380
Svetlana Semenova: marks and we decided to eliminate those who are under eight so we've covered so yeah we.

918
02:10:47.430 --> 02:11:02.070
Svetlana Semenova: need to do notification system also educational components and we also would like to provide a barcode and probably a bracelet it comes with a barcode.

919
02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:22.560
Svetlana Semenova: yeah we blend into use these technologies so our framework would be rare need to programming languages javascript and ids visual studio code for ux ui design, we will be using Sigma and for 3D modeling blender.

920
02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:29.910
Svetlana Semenova: And we also have come up with a blend of monetization maybe till the data that we did it goes we.

921
02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:43.410
Svetlana Semenova: thought that it would be helpful so for the extra price we can offer additional physical products such as bracelet and we can also offer a free trial trial period for one month.

922
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:57.750
Svetlana Semenova: We can also add some daily or weekly reports and yeah into everything will go with a monthly subscription so if you're subscribed, and you have important maybe physical products.

923
02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:08.130
Svetlana Semenova: yeah, we can also offer a delayed payment and charity organization, probably, which helps for patients.

924
02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:10.830
Svetlana Semenova: And caregivers.

925
02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:15.390
Svetlana Semenova: don't really have enough resources to buy our product.

926
02:12:16.530 --> 02:12:23.580
Svetlana Semenova: Yes, so our plan of action for the next two weeks would be to design the interface to design the bracelet.

927
02:12:24.690 --> 02:12:43.170
Svetlana Semenova: define the use cases of the user, so we can create a use case diagram to end to find content for the educational part yeah and we've separated a workload for each of them team Member yeah so that said.

928
02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:53.430
Mouzhi Ge: Stop the recording.
