Roles in Cross-functional Teams\
Dependent on the exact project teams will be built out of 3-5 persons
fulfilling all or some of these roles.

The development of an innovative digital product in healthcare needs
agile cross-functional teams. These teams develop a viable business
model based on a thoroughly identified medical need. In order to tightly
connect both business and technological aspects in the design of these
products, an integrated setup is necessary. Therefore six distinct roles
are usually present in start-up and innovation teams: Product
Management, Business Development, Medical Lead, UI/UX, Data
Engineering/AI, Software Engineering.

These roles are group in technical and market-oriented roles. The market
team jointly defines and validates a strategy and business model based
on user and customer research. The technology teams build a usable and
technically advanced product based on this research. However, they also
bring back technical possibilities and constraints into strategy
definition.
